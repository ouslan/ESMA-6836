# Homework 1


## Instructions
- Your task is to build a simulation to determine the probability a random dart thrown will hit anywhere within the circle. 
  While it is fine if you solve this problem deterministically, for this homework you must develop a simulation of 1,000,000 
  trials to estimate the probability of interest. You can use any software you wish, but you must turn in your code (by email).
  Hint: set up a coordinate system of -1,1 in x and y for the simulation.

## Code
```{python}
#| fig-align: 'center'

import numpy as np

# Define Parameters
rng = np.random.default_rng(787)
n = 1000000

x = rng.uniform(low=-1, high=1, size=n)
y = rng.uniform(low=-1, high=1, size=n)
darts = (x-0)**2 + (y-0)**2

sim = []

for dart in darts:
  if dart <= 1:
    sim.append(1)
  else:
    sim.append(0)

np.array(sim).mean()
```

## Interpretation

Running the simulation for $1,000,000$ the probability of hitting the target is $\approx 78.61\%$
